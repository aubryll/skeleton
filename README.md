# Spring boot skeleton

A simple spring boot library that implements CRUD, Services, controller, caching etc, all you need to do is
add the needed functionality to your app.
I created this for a project I was working on, the project used Cassandra and MongoDb.

Before you try to use it, you need to know this is a Reactive project, it uses Reactor Netty.
